## Environment Variables

The `.env` file is **not included in the repository**.

Each developer must create their own `.env` file inside `backend/`.

### Required variables:

```env
# MARIADB CREDENTIALS
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=<USERNAME>
DB_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
DB_NAME=LTO_IMS_DB

# DEFAULT PORT
PORT=3000
```

> ⚠️ Ask groupmates for the correct MariaDB credentials

---

## Notes

- `node_modules/` is not included — run `npm install` in both `backend` and `frontend`
- `.env` is ignored for security reasons

## Notes for Developers

- (for development only!) This project uses **`concurrently`** to run both the frontend and backend servers at the same time using a single command

  this is configured in the root `package.json`

  To run both frontend and backend together:

  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

- Please make sure that backend and frontend are properly integrated before pushing
- Make sure to use brances and create pull requests!
